## About meðŸ‘‹
### Hi, my name is Jyothi. I am currently working as a mathematics tutor, driven by my passion for math and problem-solving. Alongside teaching, I have been equipping myself with in-demand technical skills like Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL. My journey has been focused on building a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and programming.
### I am now gearing up to transition into a role where I can apply these skills professionally. With my analytical mindset and methodical approach, I am confident in my ability to tackle complex challenges and contribute meaningfully to any data-focused project or team.
